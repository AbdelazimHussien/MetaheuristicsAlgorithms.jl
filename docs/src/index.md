# MetaheuristicsAlgorithms.jl

MetaheuristicsAlgorithms.jl is a cutting-edge Julia package that provides one of the most comprehensive collections of modern metaheuristic optimization algorithms.

It includes a wide range of **Swarm-based Algorithms**, **Physical-based Algorithms**, and **Evolutionary-based Algorithms** , covering the most recent algorithms.


These algorithms belongs to the category of **Population-based Algorithms**, which are among the most common algorithms in the field of metaheuristic due to many reasons such as  
- Simplicity.
- Robustness.
- Effectiveness.
